# TODO: Come up with name for campaign

## Background

You, the party, are passengers on a merchant caravan heading south on a secluded overland route through the mountains from Elidir, capital of Isger, to Almas, capital of Andoran. You are assumed to be unfamiliar with both your fellow passengers and the caravan, unless one of the players picks a particular background tied to the story. After three days of traveling on back country roads and sleeping under the stars, Bort, the caravan master tells you that you'll have a bed to sleep in, at a stopover town, called Etran's Folly, derisively called "Plaguestone" by the other members of the caravan.
If you wish to expand on your character you might want to think of things like: What were they doing in Elidir? How long have they been in Isger? 18 years ago there was a massive war called the Goblinblood Wars, so if you've been there at least that long that probably affected you. Are they looking to skip town fast and avoid Chelaxian authorities? Or perhaps it is not the origin, but the destination. Is something awaiting them in Almas?
It's a week long journey, one way between Elidir and Almas. Did you bring all your stuff, planning to move permanently? or do you intend on returning to Elidir?
