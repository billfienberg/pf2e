## [Previous Session](./2025-03-13.md)

- We learned that we didn't uphold our end of the agreement with the wyvern so now he works for Hargulca, spying on us
- Party went to Tatsulford and met with leaders there to warn them about Hargulca and the loose vampire
- Hired someone to deliver message to Kobold City to also fortify their borders
- Returned home to Gold Coil Grotto and developed the city a bit more, including getting a keep and setting up a trade agreement with Varnhold
- Gave Falchos the lyre we found which gives him a bonus to performances and also inspired him to write a song about Aeneid, his number one fan
- In the middle of the night found that several homes were simultaneously set on fire - one of the victims was Habeem of Habeem's Kebobs
- Investigation led by Uncle Nim led us to understand that the Tear Drop gang was behind this, seeking retribution for some people you defeated a long time ago
- We tracked down the four people who set the fires, killed two, and captured the other two
- Our captives were given a trial and are now imprisoned (I think)
- Varn is visiting from Varnhold and is eager to set up trade; we plan to give him a tour in the morning
- Add 15gp and 8sp to your wealth if you haven't already
