Remembrance Brooch
Item 6
Uncommon, Invested, Magical
Usage worn brooch; Bulk —
Price 220 gp
This reversible brooch is deceptively simple at a glance. One face bears a polished emblem of nobility worked in fine metal, while the other is subdued and dark, etched with a faint, half-forgotten design. Those who look closely sometimes sense a quiet presence, as though memories long past still linger near the wearer.
Activate [one-action] Interact
Effect You flip the brooch to display its other face, gaining the benefits of that face until you activate this ability again.
The Open Crown
While the Remembrance Brooch is worn with this face visible, you gain a +1 item bonus to Diplomacy checks and a +1 item bonus to Society checks related to nobility, governance, law, or trade. When you attempt to Make an Impression, creatures of lower or equal social standing are more inclined to treat you as a person of importance, at the GM’s discretion.
The Quiet Exile
While the Remembrance Brooch is worn with this face visible, you gain a +1 item bonus to Deception checks to Lie or Impersonate and a +1 item bonus to Stealth checks in social or urban environments. When a creature attempts to identify your social status or lineage, the GM may treat you as unremarkable unless you choose to reveal your identity.
Activate [reaction] Concentrate, Mental, Emotion
Frequency once per day
Trigger You fail a Diplomacy or Deception check
Effect You reroll the triggering check and must use the new result. If the reroll succeeds, faint impressions of ancestral spirits briefly guide your thoughts, visible only to you.

### Aeneid's Gift to Crio 

>You find, wrapped in a plain cloth, an ornate and sturdy belt. The belt is a rich brown leather with ornate engravings of various beasts and plants. Affixed to the belt are four distinct pouches. One pouch is embossed with a feather and has a marble eye implanted in the center. The second pouch has a paw print and uses a fang for the enclosure. The third has tufts of fur and an owlbear claw design. The fourth and final pouch is designed with the motif of webbed, frog feet and a long tongue. This is the POcKEt dimension MONster belt for gentlepersons on the GO.
>Each of the pouches on this belt can be designated for one animal companion. Once an animal companion is designated to a pouch, that pouch takes on the characteristics of the companion therein. After a long rest, you may choose which companion to retrieve from your belt for the day. When a companion is inside its pouch, it enters a happy dream of chasing prey and rolling in grass. As an action, you may reach into one of the occupied pouches and give scritches to the companion within. When a companion is outside its pouch, the corresponding pouch is full of bottomless treats. As an action, you may reach into the unoccupied pouch and retrieve a treat.
