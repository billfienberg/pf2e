Here are some things I want us to agree on that can help us see more content and have more fun.
I spend a lot of time looking up how to resolve player actions, when I'd love to focus on advancing the story and planning NPC actions

When a player's turn is called and they do not immediately state the actions for their turn, they delay their turn

When a player takes an action I will rely on the player to know the details and mechanics such as:

- The DC rolling against
- Spell effects and DCs

If these are an unknown the players turn will pause, they will look up the effects to continue later

I am introducing a new player reward system. It is designed to help everyone more intentionally and immersively play the game.
You've heard me talk a lot about intent and approach. But really it's for a more enjoyable game. I will tally when a player choice clearly describes INTENT and APPROACH compared to choices that do not. If at the end of a session a player nets positive they get a prize (eg. healing potions). I as the GM have discretion to withold or give out more prizes based on how engaged a player is

Examples for intent and approach

```
Good Example                                                             Bad Example
I get atop the wall by climbing it with my climbing tools | I think I want to be ontop of the wall
I sweep the dogs legs to knock it down                    | I trip it
Grendel scouts ahead in the cover of darkness             | Grendel uses scout ahead
Zeus uses threats against the guards family to gain entry | Zeus threatens the guard
We spend the evening asking neighbors to find Hercules    | I ask the shopkeeper.. He asks his wife..
