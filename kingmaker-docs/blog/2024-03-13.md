# Sootscale Caverns - Tartuk's Defeat and Nettle's Curse

## Summary

The party returned to the Sootscale Caverns where they confronted Tartuk, the false priest manipulating the kobolds. Though they defeated his forces and exposed his deception, Tartuk himself escaped using invisibility. Chief Sootscale was freed from the evil influence and smashed the cursed statue. The party then encountered Davik Nettles' undead spirit at Nettle's Crossing, receiving a curse that will plague them with nightmares until they bring him the Staglord's body. The session concluded with the party leveling up to 3rd level and planning their next moves.
