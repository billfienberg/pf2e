## Summary
Major leadership restructuring occurs as the party meets Aeneid (Queen of Pitax) and Troika. Crio becomes the new Ruler while Aeneid takes over as Treasurer. The kingdom builds its first Town Hall and reaches a new level of development, though they face challenges with hex claiming and the ongoing Tent City crisis.
