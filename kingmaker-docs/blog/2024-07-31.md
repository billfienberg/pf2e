# The Lonely Barrow Expedition

## Summary

The party ventures into the dangerous hex G6, known as The Lonely Barrow. They face multiple supernatural threats including vampire bat swarms and undead skeleton champions guarding ancient secrets. The climax comes with their confrontation against The Lonely Warrior, a powerful undead guardian whose cursed blade drains the life force of those it strikes. Despite the victory, the encounter leaves lasting effects on the party. They also learn of a new quest involving Idris Tenvakian's missing brother Tevin, who disappeared near Varnhold carrying a valuable family heirloom.
