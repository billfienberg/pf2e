# River Exploration - Frogs, Fey, and Tatzlwyrms

## Summary

Following their victory at the Temple of the Elk, the party began extensive exploration of the river systems and surrounding areas. They encountered giant frogs at the Skunk River, discovered magical items including an Animalbane Bow and cold iron sword, and met various creatures including a friendly boggard and dangerous tatzlwyrms at a river ford. The party also made contact with fey creatures - Pervolash and Tig Tater Tut, as well as Melly-antz in their garden. Crio rescued a thylacine from a pit trap. The exploration revealed the diverse and dangerous nature of the Stolen Lands while the party continued their search for the Staglord.
