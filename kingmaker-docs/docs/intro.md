# Kingmaker Campaign

Welcome to our Pathfinder 2e Kingmaker campaign documentation!

## Campaign Overview

This chronicles the adventures of our party as they transform from outlaws dealing with bandit problems to the rulers of their own kingdom. The campaign follows the Pathfinder 2e Kingmaker Adventure Path.

## Party

Our adventuring party consists of various heroes, led by Nim the Kobold Sorcerer (Bill's character). Learn more about the party members in the [Party section](./party/nim.md).
