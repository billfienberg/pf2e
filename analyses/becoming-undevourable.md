### Feats

#### Feat: Fighter Dedication (from Multitalend)

>You've learned to split your focus between multiple classes with ease. You gain a 2nd-level multiclass dedication feat, even if you normally couldn't take another dedication feat until you take more feats from your current archetype. - https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=77

##### Fighter Archetype

#### Feat: Basic Maneuver => Power Attack

>You gain a 1st- or 2nd-level fighter feat. - https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=710

#### Power Attack

>You unleash a particularly powerful attack that clobbers your foe but leaves you a bit unsteady. Make a melee Strike. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If this Strike hits, you deal an extra die of weapon damage. If you’re at least 10th level, increase this to two extra dice, and if you’re at least 18th level, increase it to three extra dice. - https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=359

## Equipment

### Belt of Giant Strength

>This thick leather belt is decorated with a buckle carved from glittering quartz in the shape of a fist. You gain a +3 item bonus to Athletics checks and a +2 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to lift a heavy object, Escape, and Force Open. When you invest the belt, you either increase your Strength score by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever would give you a higher score. - https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=398

### Light Pick

- Fatal: 1d8

>On a critical hit, the weapon’s damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size,
>and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.

#### Critical Specialization

>The weapon viciously pierces the target, who takes 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. - https://2e.aonprd.com/WeaponGroups.aspx?ID=10

#### Grievous Weapon Property Rune

>Pick: The extra damage from the critical specialization effect increases to 4 per weapon damage die. - https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=298

#### Keen Weapon Property Rune

>The edges of a keen weapon are preternaturally sharp. Attacks with this weapon are a critical hit on a 19 on the die as long as that result is a success. This property has no effect on a 19 if the result would be a failure. - https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=300

#### Speed Weapon Property Rune
