## High Jump

### Action: Leap

Link: https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=81

>You take a careful, short jump. You can Leap up to 10 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least 15 feet, or up to 15 feet horizontally if your Speed is at least 30 feet. You land in the space where your Leap ends (meaning you can typically clear a 5-foot gap, or a 10-foot gap if your Speed is 30 feet or more).
>
>If you Leap vertically, you can move up to 3 feet vertically and 5 feet horizontally onto an elevated surface.

### Action: High Jump

>You Stride, then make a vertical Leap and attempt a DC 30 Athletics check to increase the height of your jump. If you didn’t Stride at least 10 feet, you automatically fail your check. This DC might be increased or decreased due to the situation, as determined by the GM.
>
>**Critical Success:** Increase the maximum vertical distance to 8 feet, or increase the maximum vertical distance to 5 feet and maximum horizontal distance to 10 feet.
>**Success:** Increase the maximum vertical distance to 5 feet.

### Action: Long Jump

>You Stride, then make a horizontal Leap and attempt an Athletics check to increase the length of your jump. The DC of the Athletics check is equal to the total distance in feet you’re attempting to move during your Leap (so you’d need to succeed at a DC 20 check to Leap 20 feet). You can’t Leap farther than your Speed.
>
>If you didn’t Stride at least 10 feet, or if you attempt to jump in a different direction than your Stride, you automatically fail your check. This DC might be increased or decreased due to the situation, as determined by the GM.
>
>**Success:** Increase the maximum horizontal distance you Leap to the desired distance.
>**Failure:** You Leap normally.
>**Critical Failure:** You Leap normally, but then fall and land prone.

### Feat: Powerful Leap (Level 2)

>When you Leap, you can jump 5 feet up with a vertical Leap, and you increase the distance you can jump horizontally by 5 feet. 

### Feat: Cloud Jump (Level 15)

Link: https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=767

>You unparalleled athletic skill allows you to jump impossible distances. Triple the distance you Long Jump (so you could jump 60 feet on a successful DC 20 check). When you High Jump, use the calculation for a Long Jump but don't triple the distance.
>
>You can jump a distance greater than your Speed by spending additional actions when you Long Jump or High Jump. For each additional action spent, add your Speed to the limit on how far you can Leap.

### Equipment: Boots of Bounding

>The springy soles of these sturdy leather boots cushion your feet and make each step lighter. These boots give you a +5-foot item bonus to your Speed and a +2 item bonus to Athletics checks to High Jump and Long Jump. In addition, when you use the Leap action, you can move 5 feet further if jumping horizontally or 3 feet higher if jumping vertically.
