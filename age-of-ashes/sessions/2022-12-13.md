### Back to the Portal

> The party walks back to the portal carrying the wizard that's been turned to stone. Everyone empties their pockets looking for the portal key. And then they collectively realize that the wizard was carrying the portal key. And now the portal key is also stone. They have no way home. The only option is to move forward, not knowing how long it will take to find a way to transform stone into flesh.
