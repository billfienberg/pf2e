### Battle Summary

#### Approach

When the party arrives at the quarry, they see armed guards standing watch on the horizon. As they move closer, they see the guards are dead. They've been impaled on spears.

As the party descends the ramp into the depths of the quarry, a Large humanoid stands up, and the battle begins.

#### Round 1

The fighter and archer advance, while the gnome wizard immediately identifies the figure as a Shadow Giant. The human wizard pulls up the hood on his Cloak of Elvenkind and disappears. Then the Shadow Giant grabs his spiked chain, and grabs a large rock. From hundreds of feet away, he throws the rock, and hits the archer like a sniper.

#### Round 2

The fighter continues advancing while you hear the human wizard's incantations coming from near the archer. Then the archer sprints unnaturally fast into range, and misses the giant with an arrow. The Shadow Giant is unworried, and starts spreading out his attacks. He hits the gnome with a rock, and then misses the archer.

#### Round 3

The fighter continues sprinting closer to the giant, unfazed by the size difference. The gnome utters an incantation and disappears. The archer moves closer, aims, and lands a Critical Hit with a arrow, infused with acid from the archer's magical bow. The Shadow Giant hits the archer with a big rock, hits the fighter with a big rock, and misses with the third throw. The party has to think quick, otherwise they'll be sniped before the fighter ever gets into melee range.

#### Round 4

Thinking quickly, the fighter takes out a magical vial, consumes it, and disappears. Then out of nowhere, the giant is hit with a Fireball. Still magically hastened, the archer moves towards the human wizard's voice. You hear a new incantation from the human wizard, but still don't see him. At the end of the spell, the archer also disappears from sight. Now the entire party is Invisible, and the Shadow Giant doesn't know what to do. So he moves towards the last known location of the fighter, and misses with a blind swing. Then, with a yell that echoes throughout the quarry, the Shadow Giant yells, "I could use some HELP!"

#### Round 5

Without seeing how, you watch the giant get cut, knocked prone, and then cut again. It seems that the fighter has reached melee range. You hear the gnome's voice cast a spell. Then you see an arrow appear out of thin air and strike the giant. The Shadow Giant stands up, and gets cut again. You can only assume it was the fighter's glaive. Now standing, the Shadow Giant swings blindly in the direction of the invisible fighter, and lands a lucky blow. You hear the fighter curse.

#### Round 6

The giant gets tripped by the invisible attacker once again. You hear the gnome's voice, and then see a small bolt of lightning materialize, and hit the giant. Out of nowhere, you see an exceptional arrow emerge from the archer's direction and strike the giant. The archer knows the arrow was guided by the magical arrowhead he found in the jungle. You hear the human wizard's voice near the fighter. It sounds like you've heard this spell before. The Shadow Giant swings blindly from the ground towards the fighter, and you hear the fighter exclaim in pain. Then the monster stands up from the ground, assesses the situation, drops his spiked chain, and admits defeat.

> You've bested me. I'm not willing to die for this. You're welcome to my treasure. It's over there.

As the Shadow Giant points towards a sack hidden behind a nearby bush, you see arrows start flying the northern end of the quarry. It seems like archers have heard the Shadow Giant's cry for help.

#### Round 7

You hear the fighter pop another cork, take a gulp, and run towards the last known location of the human wizard. You hear the human wizard cast another spell. It sounds like he's never cast this one before, but you can hear an excitement in his voice. Then you hear the flap of wings, and see a faint trail of dust moving towards the north end of the quarry. You hear, but don't see, foot steps running towards the giant.

#### Round 8

You can now tell that the archers on the nortern edge of the quarry are a pair of female elves. You can also tell that they're twins, and they seem to be more effective when working together.

You hear something land on the sheer quarry walls immediately below the cave entrance the elves are firing from. You hear the fighter's armor clink as he climbs into the cave opening. You see the left archer take a punch, and you remember that the fighter was wearing a gauntlet. Then you hear the fighter's footsteps again. He must be repositioning. And before you even what hit them, one of the elves is shoved from the cave opening. She falls 30 feet to the quarry floor. She gets the wind knocked out of her, but she's still got a lot of fight left in her.

You haven't seen or heard the human archer or gnome recently. But if you were paying close attention, you noticed the giant's sack of treasure is no longer there. You wonder how the human and/or the gnome could have possibly moved the giant-sized sack of treasure.

Surprised and frustrated, the elf on the quarry floor stands up, and fires blindly. She lands a lucky shot, and you hear the human wizard's voice wince in pain. It almost sounds like the timbre of his voice changed, like he increased in size. But you're not sure, you haven't actually seen him since he entered the quarry.

Preferring to fight alongside her twin, the archer in the cave opening voluntarily jumps down to the quarry floor. Using her advanced acrobatic skills, she's able to time her landing roll correctly to reduce the pain from the 30-foot fall. She fires aimlessly into the sky and misses.

While all this is going on, the Shadow Giant successfully flees, and a gang of thugs emerge from the cave opening to the south.

#### Round 9

You hear another potion get popped and chugged, and remember that the fighter is the party's Battle Medic. "How many of those does he have?" you wonder. Then you hear the gnome's voice, and a Geyser erupts beneath the elves. However, the elves are very dextruous, and manage to avoid being lifted off the ground. The archers continue firing blindly, but it's hard to hit what you can't see. On the other side of the quarry, the thugs continue moving towards the commotion.

#### Round 10

You hear the flapping of wings again, and a line of acid is sprayed across both elves. You surmise that the party's human archer has made it into range because you see an arrow appear, hit one of the elves, and watch the wound burn with acid. You then watch another arrow whiz past the elves. The elves continues firing, and continue missing. The thugs are only halfway across the quarry at this point... It's a big quarry.

#### Round 11

You hear another big flapping of wings, notice a dust cloud next to the elf that was pushed into the quarry. You see what look like multiple puncture wounds appear on the flanked elf, and can only assume the elf has been bitten by something with large teeth. Then, from the opposite side, you see the elf get tripped and sliced. You're not sure what's going on, but it seems like two different invisible parties are teaming up againt this elf.

A familiar voice cuts through the battle, and you recognize it as the gnome. Then you watch an icy ray strikre the unflanked elf, and the gnome becomes visivble.

Two more arrows emerge from a suspected source. One hits, and one misses.

Unable to fire her bow from the ground, the prone elf is forced to stand up. However, as she attemps to stand, you watch a stab wound appear in her ribs, and the elf collapse to ground, dead. Her sister yells out in torment, and fires with blind rage in the direction of her sister's killer. Two of the arrows miss, but you hear one hit when you hear the fighter grimace.

Meanwhile, the thugs are getting closer. If the party doesn't doesn't dispatch the last elf soon, the party may end up surrounded.

#### Round 12

The gnome shouts, "I don't want to be on this quarry floor when those thugs get here." Then you hear the flapping of wings again, and watch the gnome get scopped by an invisible force, and lifted to the cave opening where the archers were originally firing from.

You watch the standing elf get stabbed by an unseen aggressor, and subsequently tripped, again. Then, the fighter appears. He knows he needs to find a way off this quarry floor before the thugs arrive.

Then you hear the gnome cast an unfamiliar spell, and see a fiery vortex appear near the elf. Somehow, the elf manages to successfully avoid the fire tornado.

Then two more arrows shoot towards the elf, and they both miss. Then the human archer appears. It seems like whatver magic was concealing him has worn off.

The elf is keenly aware of her situation. She knows that she's been blessed enough to evade many of the recent attacks, but she also knows that her sister perished when trying to stand up from prone. And most importantly, as an archer, she is certain she has no other choice...

She stands up, and gets skewered by the invisible blade that claimed her sister. As it happens, she thinks, "Of course, my twin sister and I die the same death?!"

All the while, the thugs are getting closer. If the party doesn't do something soon, they might be pinned against the quarry walls.

#### Round 13

You hear the flutter of sizeable wings, watch the human archer get picked up, and lifted to the elevated cave entrance. It seemns there is an invisible ferry at work.

The now-visible fighter tries to take cover near the quarry wall.

The gnome maintains the blistering blast, and utters a defensive spell to defend against he incoming thugs' javelins and arrows.

The now-visible archer fires focuses on one of the leaders, and fire two arrows in a row. One missed, and one hit.

#### Round 14

With another hidden but audible beat of wings, you see the fighter plcuked from the ground by an unseeable ally, and dropped in the cave opening.

Then you watch the fighter administer emergency first aid to the gnome and the archer.

Confient, the gnome commands the cinder cyclone to hit the closest enemy. Afterwards, the gnome evokes the full electric force of Golarion, and masterfully routes a magical lightning bolt through all of the thugs. Despite only eliminating one of the enemies, the party heralds it as one of the most perfect spells ever cast.

The human archer fires another two arrows. The first misses, and the second hits. Then the archer takes cover in the cave.

The mob of thugs moves into range, and commences their ranged attacks with javelins and short bows. The gnome gets hit by a couple of the ranged attacks, but is undeterred.

#### Round 15

From the cave opening, you hear the threshing of wings, and see a cloud of dust waft up near the farthest thug leader. With one roar, all three thug leaders get with a surprise line of acid. Two survive, but one dies. After the dfeath of their superior, two of the dwarves no longer feel compelled to fight, and begin to flee.

Preferring the safety of the higher ground, the human fighter takes out their magical starknife, and commences target practice.

The gnome directs the flame vortex, and then casts another spell. Now there are multiple gnome copies.

The archer moves out from behind the cave wall, kills one of the leaders with an arrow, and then misses the last remaining leader.

A couple more dwarven thugs flee, while some advance, and glance the archer with with javelins and arrows.

Sensing there's an enermy undetectable, the one of the leaders appears to land a lucky blow, and you hear the human wizard get knocked down.

#### Round 16

One of the leaders shouts out in pain, and then you hear the flapping of wings in the direction of the cave opening.

Outside of melee range, the fighter drops his glaive. He draws his starknife, throws it, and then it magically returns to his hand. Then he draws another potion.

The gnome hits with the flaming funnel towards the remaining thug leaders and thugs.

The archer pops out, hits with one arrow, and then misses with another.

Reduced in number, but still determined, the dwarves lob another volley of javelins and arrow at the archer. One of the blows is a critical hit, and incapitates the archer. Then one of the arrows lands in his limp body. The archer is on death's door.

#### Round 17

Hoping the last of the thugs would flee, you hear the human wizard's voice, and then an fireball erupts near the thug leaders.

The remaining dwarves begin fleeing, and two get killed by the gnone's spell.

Then the fighter revives the archer with the potion.

One emerges from the southern cave entrance yelling, "I'm going to retreat to the hills. You're never going to catch me."

### Highlights

- Caius pushes one of the twins in an epic fashion
- > Brad: Iva stands up from prone in a flame vortex, and she braces for the final blow from her invisible attacker. She died the same way her twin sister died.
- > Brad: So he gets hit with a flame vortex, and then gets disintegrated by a massive lightning bolt.
