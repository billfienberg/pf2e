### Day ??

#### Elven Writing

- Desna

#### Abyssal Writing

> Praise to Albestia for succulent nightmares

- Definitely something sinister

#### The Great Dreamhouse AKA Temple of Desna

Greeted by Kellen Parandal, male elf cleric of Desna

#### Vaz' House

Find an old book about hags and Desna

- Hags like Desna because hags believe dreams are their realm, not Desna
- Hags are strong spellcasters (caged prisons, sucking souls from deceased, take on strange pets from ethereal realm)
- Don't fall asleep and/or become unconscious around a hag
